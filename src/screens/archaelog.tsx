        <h2>Museum of Archeology and Ethnography.</h2>
        <p>
          The Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Kyrgyz National
          Complex 'Manas Ordo' consists of two large parts of archaeology and
          ethnography and contains the ancient life and progress of the Talas
          Valley and Kyrgyzstan from the Stone Age to the present day.

          This map shows the places where the monuments of the Stone Age were
          found. Which proves that people have lived in our and neighboring
          territories since the Stone Age. The expositions show Paleolithic
          stones that were found in the Naryn region, in Teke-Sekirik in the
          Batken region, and in the Issyk-Kul region in the place of Ak-Olon. In
          the Talas region, Stone Age monuments have recently begun to be
          studied, and according to the story of archaeologists, a lot of traces
          of people who lived in the Stone Age were found in the Kumushtak
          gorge. Because the structural, black stones suitable for the
          manufacture of weapons are located in the Kumushtak gorge, and, of
          course, the people of the Stone Age knew this. And also here are the
          stone tools that were found on the territory of our complex.

          The second part of the exhibition is dedicated to the Bronze Age. In
          this century, the so-called Andronovo people lived in our territories.
          They have mastered metal mining very well. The oldest and most
          valuable exhibit of our museum is the dagger that you see in our
          exposition, which belongs to the Bronze Age. There are a lot of Bronze
          Age monuments in Kyrgyzstan: parking lots, ancient cemeteries and rock
          paintings. Famous archaeologists, Bakyt Amanbayeva and Chynarbek
          Zholdoshev, discovered Bronze Age monuments during the study of the
          Kenkol burial grounds, which made a great contribution to science.
          Prior to that, the monuments of the Bronze Age were studied by the
          archaeologist of Codecs in Tash-Dobo and Terskol. Moreover, a lot of
          petroglyphs also belong to the Bronze Age. We are sure that the study
          of these petroglyphs will reveal a lot of information about the Bronze
          Age. On the stand there is a photo taken during an expedition to the
          Bronze Age mounds, where our scientific staff of the Manas Ordo
          complex study the monuments.

          The most interesting finds belong to the early Iron Age. This century
          is known in science as the Saka-Usun era. In ancient writings in the
          territories of Tenir-Too and Zheti-Suu, our ancient ancestors Sakas
          and later Usuni roamed. They are known as Sakas in the ancient
          chronicles of China, Farsi and Persian scripts. They left large and
          small mounds (cemeteries). Archaeologists, having studied these
          mounds, came to the conclusion that they were nomads, but our
          archaeologists say that our ancestors were a semi-nomadic people.
          Because when they investigated their bets, they found a huge number of
          hand mills and pottery. This proves that some of the nomads lived in
          one place and were engaged in metal mining, needlework and
          agriculture. About 100 hand mills were found in the village of
          Kozuchak in the Talas region. Some of these grain grinders are also on
          display here. And we can call these nomads engaged in agriculture
          semi-nomads.
