          Before the advent of the Internet, the role of newspapers in the life
          of society was huge. Newspapers, popular science and fiction were the
          main means of storing and transmitting from generation to generation
          all the achievements of science and culture. For people of all ages,
          magazines and newspapers serve as a source of knowledge, help to learn
          and appreciate life, understand the laws of social relations and
          natural phenomena.That is why the old original copies are kept in the
          archives of the Talas Regional Library. The archive is a place of
          connection of the past, present and future. Thanks to the archive, the
          connection of time, the history of the development of culture and
          social life is preserved. This is the significance of the archive as a
          source of cultural and historical information.
