        <h2>Kumbez of Manas - The Saint Legacy.</h2>
        <p>
          The first information about the Kumbez of Manas was found by the
          famous Orientalist V.V. Bartold. This famous Russian scientist in
          1893-1894-wrote a scientific paper 'Report of a Trip to Central Asia.
          This photo is now one of the first pictures of Manas Kumbez. Further
          Kumbez Manas was explored by P.P. Ivanov in 1923, M.E. Masson in 1937
          under the leadership of F.I. Zuma the first archaeological excavations
          were carried out.
        </p>
        <p>
          During excavations in the eastern part of the Kumbez, two coffins were
          found. One with the remaining part of male body, and the second one
          with haphazardly scattered human remains and female jewelry. In 1938,
          Kumbez was explored by the Smerecha archaeological expedition of the
          Archaeological Institute of the Scientific Academy of the USSR, led by
          A.N. Bernshtam. This time two more coffins were found in the kumbez
          itself, and then even lower at a depth of 11 meters were found the
          remains of a man 50-60 years old, more than two and a half meters
          tall, with a special structure of the skull and body parts. According
          to the epic, Manas, the national hero of Kyrgyz people left this world
          at the age of 50-60.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is known from the work that after the death of Manas, the wise
          Kanykei ordered to bring the earth from Kokand mixed with white clay,
          goat hair and goat fat, to make bricks and build a kumbez, over which
          time has no power. And to avoid desecrating the grave of the Kyrgyz
          khan, the wise Kanykei started a rumor about burying Manas in the
          mountains of Echkili Too. Archaeological research showed that the
          composition of bricks contains goat fat and hair. The remains of
          authentic bricks with human and animal footprints are kept among the
          museum exhibits. The sanctuary as an example of the unique culture of
          the ancient people in 1923 was taken under the protection of the
          Kyrgyz government. Additional restoration work was carried out before
          the celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the epic 'Manas'. Kumbez
          of Manas is visited daily by pilgrims from Kyrgyzstan and tourists
          from near and far abroad.
